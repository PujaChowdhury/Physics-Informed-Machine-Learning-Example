# Physics-Informed-Machine-Learning-Example


A basic example of how physics informed machine learning can be used to enhance structural dynamics modeling.

## [Data](data)

This repo contains vibration data for a cantilever beam as shown below. A video of the system is also posted at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50uMt-VIjR8

The time-frequency response of the beam is shown in the spectrogram of the system below. Not the upward shift in frequency for all three modes after the mass drop.
