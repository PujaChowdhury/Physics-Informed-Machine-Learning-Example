## Directories
[Frequency state space code](frequency_state_space_code)
1. Code from the DROPBEAR done in the summer of 2019. 
2. Solve the frequency-based solution of the beam in the frequency domain using the generalized eigenvalue approach
3. Solves the discrete temporal response of DROPBEAR using state space modeling. this code has an error in it. 


[EOM code with numerical solver](EOM_code_with_numerical_solver)
1. A basic EOM for a simply supported beam with a numerical solver to solve each time step.
